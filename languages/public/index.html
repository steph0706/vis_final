      <p class='intro__dek'>
        <p>The world is home to approximately 7000 living languages. In an increasingly globalized world, we find that cultural exchange and interaction becomes more commonplace. As such, the need to study foreign languages for both personal and career development rises. This project provides insight to the current linguistic landscape of the world, with the goal of increasing historical intuition and cultural awareness.</p>
          <p>Language and culture are deeply interconnected concepts which tie in to individual identities. In the end, every individualâ€™s identity is molded by our environment. By being cognizant of cultural diversity, we, as human beings, can further increase mutual understanding, leading to a more harmonious world.</p>

        <p>English, now known as the <i>lingua franca</i> of the modern era, is an official or main language of 60 nations, highlighted in the map. With the worldwide spread of English due to British Imperialism and the strength of Anglosphere nations, English has influenced many other languages -- even resulting in their extinctions. On the bright side, the use of English as a lingua franca connects an estimated one billion people in business, tourism, and online media.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='step' data-step='2'>
        <p>While English enjoys widespread acceptance, the most spoken language of the world is Chinese, at 1.5 billion speakers. Chinese, particularly Mandarin, is the official language of only three nations as shown on the map: China, Taiwan, and Singapore.</p> <p>While Chinese was certainly a beneficiary of linguistic imperialism in history, contrasting the current insular state of Chinese with English reflects the geopolitical climate of modern history. With that said, the Chinese language continues to grow with China's recently realized status as a world power.</p>

        <p>Languages are classified into families, encapsulating genetic similarities between related languages. This treemap displays the amount of languages in each language family, giving insight on the linguistic diversity in certain geographic areas.</p><p> The large size of Niger-Congo and Austronesian language families show the small, but plentiful ethnic groups that can be found in their respective regions. Interestingly, most of the world's most spoken languages come from the Indo-European family, which includes English and Romance Languages, despite it being only being a fifth of the size of the largest language family.</p>

        <p>This diagram presents the world population's language breakdown, drawing special attention to the top ten most spoken languages (by native speakers).</p>

        <p>We confirm the popularity of the Indo-European language, but also see that none of the other top languages come close to rivalling Mandarin Chinese for most spoken language. At the same time, we see that almost a half of the world's native language falls outside of the top languages. Perhaps this is a bit eye-opening to realize that most of the world population is unreachable in terms of language.</p>

        <p>This diagram summarizes the distribution of languages in the world by the number of native speakers. It categorizes languages by the population size of first language speakers.<br /><br />Only 1.3% of all languages are spoken by more than 10,000,000 people, and only 23 languages account for more than half the world's population. This reflects the state of our globalizing world. More and more people are learning other languages to foster communication between people. With the advancement of technology, information access and social networks have become increasingly popular. People want to be able to communicate with people of other cultures and languages, and to do so they must speak a common language. <br /> On the flip side, this means that many languages are slowly dying off. Roughly a third of the world's languages are endangered, with less than 1,000 speakers remaining.<br /><br/>Hover to explore the number of languages organized by number of speakers</p>

        <p>This chart contrasts the number of L1 (native) speakers of a language to the number of L2 (second language) speakers in millions. It is organized from the highest number of L1 speakers to the lowest. As illustrated in the chart, Chinese is quite strikingly the language with the most number of native speakers, with 1,284 million native speakers. However, the number of L2 speakers is significantly lower with only 193 million. This perhaps reflects the difficulty level of learning Chinese in contrast to most other languages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='step1' data-step='4'>
        <p>This chart, contrastingly, is organized by the number of L2 speakers. English, as noted before is one of the most dominant languages in the world and this is reflected in the data. It is the number one most common second language in the world. It is predicted by 2050, that half the world will be more or less proficient in English. It is the language of globalization. Moreover, many computer languages are based off of English which further perpetuates the strength of the English language and perhaps reflects the strength of the Anglosphere nations. It may well continue to be the lingua franca of the world due to ease of access.</p>

    <p>It is estimated that one language dies every two weeks. In a century, half of the currently existing languages will go extinct, marking the end of a culture and the history that it carries.</p></br>
    <p>While we can, let's celebrate the rich diversity that exists in our world. Learn from your friends and your neighbors -- even the smallest things that we take for granted, like language, can carry significant amounts of knowledge.</p>
